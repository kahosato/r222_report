There is an increasing interest in Native Language Identification (NLI).
Native Language Identification involves detecting the native language (L1) of the author of the text.
This is a sub-task of author profiling, where the goal is to predict traits of the author such as gender, age or psychometric traits \citep{estival2007author}.
Author profiling has been used to combat the criminal activity\citep{abbasi2005applying} to gain an insight to the suspects by analysing the online mediums used for communication among them.
